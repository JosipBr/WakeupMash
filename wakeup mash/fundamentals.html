        <h1>FIGHTING GAMES: FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
    </section>
</section>

<section class="paragraph1">
    <h1>LETS GET STARTED</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>It's has always been hard for everyone to get into Fighting games. There is a learning curve that terrifies everyone on the first glance. New comers don’t want to spend their free time how to basically “walk” in a video game for a very long time. Even the in-game tutorials can take you so far. That’s why I’ll try to cover all the basis of the fighting games. Take your time with going through all of this information. It can seem like a lot at first, but with time you will master it all.</p>

<section class="paragraph1">
    <h1>BASIC FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Fundametnals consist of:<i> Movement, Poking,  Punishing, Taking turns, Blocking, Anti-airing, Positional-awareness, Wakeup</i> etc. Having mastered these fundamentals makes you ready to play any fighting game. You will feel more comfortable while switching from one fighting game to another. The most basic way to describe fundamentals is that there are different situations that you need to handle:<i> Offense, Defense and Neutral</i>.</p>

<section class="paragraph">
    <h1>1. MOVEMENT</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Movement is one of the key factors since it determines the way you can approach your enemy. You can either be close to your opponent, at medium range, full-screen and air-borne. Every single position opens up different ways to create offensive pressure against your opponent. It can also determine your defensive approach. There are also specific characters who excel depending on their position. <b>SSJ4 Gogeta from DBFZ</b> is a chracater who wants to be in your opponents face all the time.</p>

    <h1>2. POKING</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Poking includes using your fastest moves to create pressure or inflict small damage. It’s one of the best ways to get in your opponents face. They are usually <i>safe on block</i>, meaning that they can’t <i>punish you</i>. They are a low-risk button that can make a big difference in a game.</p>

    <h1>3. BLOCKING</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Blocking is a chore mechanic of every fighting game. Some players dislike this mechanic, but it’s this factor that separates good and bad players. To block properly, you need to understand different properties of attacks: <i>High, Mid, Low, Unblockable, Grabs</i>. <b>High</b> attacks can be blocked standing and avoided by crouching. <b>Low</b> attacks can only be blocked by crouching. <b>Unblockables</b> can’t be blocked but they are usually very slow moves. <b>Grabs</b> are another type of unblockables that require a specific input or movement to avoid them.</p>

    <h1>4. TAKING TURNS</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Fighting games can sometimes be chaotic, but they have a proper way when to do some specific movement options.  In <i>neutral</i> everyone is free to do whatever they want to do. Once someone starts to create pressure, the opponent waits for the pressure to end to take back their turn. If the aggressor continues to press buttons, he can get punished since his <i>strings</i> aren’t designed to last forever.</p>

<section class="paragraph">
    <h1>5. WAKEUPS</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Wakeups are a specific situation where you end up after the opponent finishes a combo on you. In most situations, you are forced to continue taking pressure from your opponent after the wakeup. Every fighting game has a different approach to this mechanic. There are different defensive mechanics that go around this.</p>

<section class="paragraph">
    <h1>6. ANTI-AIRING</h1>
    <section class="pr">
        <p>Anti-airing is stopping your opponents air movements. It usually consists of specific attacks who have <i>anti-air properties</i>  that deal easily with these situations. Every game has different anti-air mechanics but they all have the same function.</p>
